# sim-virtual

In this project for Operating Systems, we simulated 3 algorithms for page replacement: LRU, NRU and Second Chance.
We tested each algorithm with an input of 4 programs with 1M memory accesses each, with different memory sizes available and different page frame sizes.

It can be seen in the charts generated that all algorithms have quite similar behaviors.
